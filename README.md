### Heart Disease Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of heart disease in individuals based on various health metrics. Early prediction of heart disease can assist healthcare professionals in making timely decisions for preventive care, which can ultimately save lives. By training several machine learning algorithms on patient data, this project seeks to identify the most effective model for accurate heart disease prediction.

### Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Load the dataset, handle missing values, and standardize features using `StandardScaler` to prepare the data for machine learning.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Use visualization techniques to understand relationships in the data and identify any trends associated with heart disease.
3. **Model Training and Testing**: Split the dataset into training and testing sets, then apply each of the six algorithms to train the models.
4. **Evaluation**: Calculate and compare metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score for each model to identify the best-performing one.
5. **Result Analysis**: Discuss insights, such as the most influential features, and possible improvements.
