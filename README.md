## Project Overview

Early detection of heart disease can help prevent severe health issues, saving lives through timely intervention. This project utilizes machine learning models to classify patients as being at risk of heart disease based on factors such as age, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and other medical metrics. By comparing multiple algorithms, we determine the best model for accurate predictions, assisting healthcare providers in making data-driven decisions.

## Features

- **Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize data to identify patterns associated with heart disease.
- **Model Training**: Implement and train multiple machine learning models including:
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
  - Decision Tree
  - Random Forest
  - Naive Bayes
- **Model Evaluation**: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
- **Feature Importance**: Identify key features contributing to heart disease risk.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core programming language.
- **Libraries**:
  - `Pandas` and `NumPy` for data manipulation and numerical operations.
  - `Scikit-Learn` for model implementation and evaluation.
  - `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn` for data visualization.
- **Environment**: Jupyter Notebook or any Python IDE for code development.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/heart-disease-prediction.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```bash
   cd heart-disease-prediction
   ```

3. Install the required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```


4. (Optional) Set up a virtual environment for better dependency management:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook or run the Python script for the project.
   
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook heart_disease_prediction.ipynb
   ```
   
2. Run the notebook cells in sequence to load the data, preprocess it, train models, and evaluate their performance.

3. Review the model evaluation results to determine the most effective model.

## Results

After training and evaluating various models, this project presents the performance of each model in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score. The insights gained help identify key risk factors for heart disease, potentially guiding preventive healthcare efforts.
